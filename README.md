### Date created
4th of July 2019

### Project Title
Bikeshare data analysis

### Description
The project allows users to analyze the bikeshare data for three cities: Chicago, New York and Washington. The project provides the data for the first 6 months of 2018, and allows users to filter the data by city, month and day of the week. The project outputs statistical data for the data set filtered by the user.


### Files used
We use data files in csv format provided for each city:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

These files are added in the .gitignore file

### Credits
We thank Bikeshare for sharing the data files and Udacity for teaching us how to code.
